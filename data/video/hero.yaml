# To configure a background video for your header you will 
# need to configure the Formstone Background plugin in the 
# static/js/vitality.js file. You must also be using the header structure 
# used in the video.html sample file. You will also want to edit the 
# file path of the mobile fallback image. Or just copy your video clip
# over static/mp4/camera.mp4
